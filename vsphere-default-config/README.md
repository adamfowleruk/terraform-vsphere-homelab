# vSphere Default Config

Creates an inintial vSphere nested homelab configuration,
and sets up vCenter for HA.

Note that this sets up vSphere assuming a completely
air gapped environment. You need to separately configure the upstream
router for Internet access. See the
[pfsense-routing README](../pfsense-routing/README.md)
for details.
